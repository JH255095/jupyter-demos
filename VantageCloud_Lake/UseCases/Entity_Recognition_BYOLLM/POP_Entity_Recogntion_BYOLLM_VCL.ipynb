    "This notebook is designed for developers, data scientists, and AI practitioners who want to bring open-source Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) closer to their data — quickly, securely, and at scale. As organizations race to deploy AI applications, developers face key challenges: selecting the right model, minimizing data movement, ensuring security, and controlling costs.  Teradata’s Bring Your Own LLM (BYO-LLM) capability addresses these challenges by allowing you to deploy open-source <b>Hugging Face</b> models directly inside VantageCloud — where your data already lives.\n",
