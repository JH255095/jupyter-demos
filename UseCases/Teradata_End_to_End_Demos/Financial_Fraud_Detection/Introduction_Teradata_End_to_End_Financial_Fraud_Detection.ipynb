    "    In recent years we have seen a massive increase in Fraud attempts, making fraud detection imperative for Banking and Financial Institutions. Despite countless efforts and human supervision, hundreds of millions of dollars are lost due to fraud. Fraud can happen using various methods, i.e., stolen credit cards, misleading accounting, phishing emails, etc. Due to small cases in significant populations, fraud detection has become more and more challenging. \n",
